Just experimenting on fuzzy logic, to create a neural network from scratch. 

Using github as my hosting space and backup storage. :)
Not important...
Go away!

Well. I believe that the normalization which is needed to be achieved for neural networking is easily possible with fuzzy logic. of course, fuzzy logic limits calculations between 0 and 1. But I couldn't still find the perfect function to make the outputs uniform such that, fuzzy variables follow the same set of boolean logic at every value. 

You can help me, always. :D
